## TODO:
Blocks
- block size variations
- block patterns
- block images

Input
- player avatar/vehicle
- vehicle control

Feedback
- assistive feedback
- haptic feedback to keep the player within the frame boundaries

## Notes:
We need to design the obstacles so the feedback forces we can produce are actually helpful. For complicated scenarios where we need to choose a difficult maneuver in order to avoid an impossible situation later, simple force feedback will not work.
